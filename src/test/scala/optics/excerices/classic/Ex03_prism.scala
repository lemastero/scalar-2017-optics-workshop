        A Prism is a Iso that can be partial in one direction.
        A Prism is an optic which converts S into T if S is defined in T. Backward conversion is always valid.

        Valid prim should convert string into m/s if a string contains valid numeric value $test01.
        Otherwise it returns None $test02.
        Converting from m/s to string is always possible because it's valid string $test03.
        Prism allows to modify source value $test04 or return unchanged if conversion is impossible $test05.

        This is not a full truth about prism but for simplicity we will stick with it.
        If you are curious checkout the lenses documentation.
